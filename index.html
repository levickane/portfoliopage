        <div class="sectionContainer" id="aboutMeText">
          <p>
            My name is Levi Kane and I'm former World Class Athlete, turned
            Fitness Training Coach, turned Full Stack Developer. In 2012 I was
            introduced to the sport of ParaTriathlon where I would be racing
            against other athletes with the same level of disability as myself
            (above-knee amputee). In the year 2015 I had hit my personal peak
            with athletics getting a Gold medal at National championships,
            Silver medal at World Championships, a Bronze medal at Continental
            Championships and I became the first (and still the only) single-leg
            above-knee amputee to ever run a sub 20:00 5k in the entire World.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, I ran my own fitness training and coaching business for
            5 years. Using my education in Kinesiology, paired with my story of
            inspiration, my business flourished! But then sadly, due to
            Covid-19, my business was brought to a screeching hault. And that's
            when I thought, <em>"Why don't I learn how to write code??"</em> My
            favorite clients were always developers, so asking them for advice
            on the matter only seemed natural. So after some guidence from
            seasoned veterans of the industry, I spent my Covid-cation immersing
            myself in the world of applicaiton development, learning as much as
            I could and even earning a short term paid-internship with company
            in which I was contracted to build their website using Vue and can
            be seen at
            <a
              href="https://www.newgameplus.live/"
              target="_blank"
              style="text-decoration: underline"
              >www.newgameplus.live</a
            >
            (with the mutual agreement to not continue employment after the
            contract was over). When my internship came to a close, the CTO told
            me that I had the same skill set as someone coming out of a
            bootcamp, but still recommended that I join one to not just sharpen
            my skillset, but also for both building the network of peers and for
            the professional coaching on how to acutally land a job within the
            incredibly competetive Tech industry.

            So that's how I found myself here! A student at Northwestern
            University's Coding Bootcamp. The web-applications listed below are
            all custom built by me, from scratch, through the University's
            curriculum. At the bottom you'll find my contact info as well as my
            resume which can viewed in a downloadable PDF
